                <p>
                    I was born in Geneva, Switzerland. After studying most of my schooling in Switzerland in a
                    Boarding
                    School, I wanted a professional experience before college. </p>

                <p> My family is in Fashion Business in New York and Europe. I had decided to
                    join
                    the company
                    and be a
                    part
                    of the innovation and business development.

                    I decided at that point to learn about coding, which is the base technology, and to understand
                    the
                    structure. Coding will help me understand how to enhance my knowledge and, in addition, be able
                    to
                    code
                    my ideas and develop them. </p>

                <p>I am very excited to join your Software Engineering program; it will be the
                    right
                    decision. I
                    want
                    to
                    start this program to bring my ideas to life. Once I graduate, I will put my new skills into all
                    my
                    business ideas.
