                    <p className="about-p">
                        I was born in Geneva, Switzerland. After studying most of my schooling in Switzerland in a
                        Boarding
                        School, I wanted a professional experience before college.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p className="about-p"> My family is in Fashion Business in New York and Europe. I had decided to
                        join
                        the company
                        and be a
                        part
                        of the innovation and business development.

                        I decided at that point to learn about coding, which is the base technology, and to understand
                        the
                        structure. Coding will help me understand how to enhance my knowledge and, in addition, be able
                        to
                        code
                        my ideas and develop them.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p className="about-p">I am very excited to join your Software Engineering program; it will be the
                        right
                        decision. I
                        want
                        to
                        start this program to bring my ideas to life. Once I graduate, I will put my new skills into all
                        my
                        business ideas.
